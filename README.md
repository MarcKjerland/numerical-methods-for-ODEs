# numerical-methods-for-ODEs
This project provides an introduction to numerical methods for differential equations, including a technical outline and implentation in MATLAB/Octave. Several simple ODE solvers and test functions are provided, and in particular their results are compared to show differences in accuracy and stability.

This tutorial was written for a July 2016 presentation to coastal engineering students at Kyoto University.
