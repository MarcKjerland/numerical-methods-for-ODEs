# numerical-methods-for-ODEs
This project provides an introduction to numerical methods for differential equations, including a technical outline and implentation in MATLAB/Octave. Several simple ODE solvers and test functions are provided, and in particular their results are compared to show differences in accuracy and stability.

To run the MATLAB scripts, navigate to the 'code' directory and run the command 'numerical_tests'. Methods include the Forward and Backward Euler, Midpoint (RK2), and standard 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4). To change the test function, edit 'numerical_tests.m'; a few simple 1d methods are included as well as the 2D predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) and 3D Lorenz 1963 systems.

This tutorial was written for a July 2016 presentation to coastal engineering students at Kyoto University.
